# JEO WordPress Theme

JEO WordPress Theme acts as a geojournalism platform which allows news organizations, bloggers and NGOs to publish news stories as layers of information on digital maps. With JEO, creating the interaction between data layers and contextual information is much more intuitive and interactive. The theme is ready for multilingual content and facilitates the publishing tasks.

You can post geotagged stories and create richly designed pages for each one of the featured stories. At same time, by simply imputing the ids of layers hosted on MapBox, you can manage sophisticated maps without loosing perfomance, add legends directly with HTML and set the map paramethers. All direct at the WordPress dashboard.

JEO wants to help journalists and NGOs to improve storytelling with maps. Creating a child theme with all its functionality is easy since it contains all the necessary hooks to customize layouts and data visualization.
